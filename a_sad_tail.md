House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark waltzed into the castle and toasted his poptarts. They were
wild berry flavored and delicious. He snapchatted a picture of his half
eaten poptart to his girlfriend.
